        doc: "Evaporation is when a liquid changes into a gas. Liquid water evaporates to become a gas called water vapor.Evaporation happens when a liquid is heated. The heat gives the iquidâ€™s molecules more energy. This energy causes the molecules to move faster. If they gain enough energy, the molecules near the surface break away. These molecules escape the liquid and enter the air as gas."

When it cools, the vapor condenses into water droplets that can stay liquid or freeze into hail or snowflakes. If enough condensation collects to saturate the air, it will fall back to earth as precipitation.'
